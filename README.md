Sustainability: The Plastic Footprint  
Predicting Plastic Landfill Risk using Waste Management Data

📖 Project Overview
Plastic waste is one of the fastest-growing environmental challenges.  
This project analyzes plastic waste composition data at **country and city levels (2024)** and uses statistical modeling to **predict plastic waste trends for 2025** and **identify landfill overflow risk regions for 2026**.

The goal is to help policymakers and urban planners **identify high-risk regions early** and take preventive action.

Business Problem
Landfills have limited capacity. Rapid growth in plastic waste can cause:
- Environmental pollution
- Health hazards
- Waste management failure

This project answers:
- Which countries and cities already have **high plastic contribution**?
- Which regions will likely **exceed landfill capacity first**?
- Where should intervention be prioritized?
